# Jarvis Autobot 🤖

A Python-powered desktop personal assistant with voice recognition, GPT-based responses, and a custom Tkinter GUI interface. Inspired by Marvel's **JARVIS**, this assistant is designed to interact naturally with the user and handle advanced tasks like question-answering, web browsing, and more.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎙️ Voice Recognition (Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech)
- 🧠 GPT-based conversational AI with memory
- 📚 Question answering using Hugging Face Transformers
- 🌐 Web interaction and command execution
- 🖼️ Tkinter-based animated GUI
- 🧵 Threaded async responses for real-time interaction
- 🎞️ GIF support and multimedia feedback
- 🔐 Modular code structure for easy expansion

## 🧠 `chatbot.py` Overview

This file handles:
- Loading pre-trained GPT or Transformer models via Hugging Face
- Tokenizing user input
- Generating AI responses using models like `gpt2` or `bert`
- Integrating with pipelines for question-answering and context-based replies
- (Optionally) memory/contextual support for better conversations
