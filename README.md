## 📌 About `chatbot.py`

This file manages:

* Model loading from Hugging Face (`AutoModelForCausalLM`, `TFAutoModelForQuestionAnswering`)
* Tokenizing input for GPT or BERT-style models
* Generating meaningful replies from AI models
* (Optional) context memory for enhanced conversations

Example:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("gpt2")

inputs = tokenizer("Hello, who are you?", return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs)
response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0])
```
